And how is this going to affect Moab’s precious OHV crowd we’re so scared to annoy? Is access to popular routes going to get more challenging for them? How is this going to impact neighborhoods around access to this, and oh, can we get an upgraded grocery store maybe??\r\nIs there going to be any additional protection of archeology in the area or are we going to lose that to more vandalism?",

It would be a different story if it was providing housing to our residents or seasonal work force. This is a road I frequently like to bike and is very narrow, with increased traffic I can only imagine it will become much more unsafe to bike on. The area where the development has already begun to happen is a spot that I would often see deer grazing and enjoying the peace (not anymore). Looking across the river from Wall Street to Kane creek at the rock find has long been one of my favorite views of the area but will soon include views of buildings. I also have witnessed the destruction of cottonwood trees which are so important to our ecosystem especially along the Colorado River.",

    "comment": "My time spent in Grand County had always given me a sense of peace and tranquility. As someone who lives in a overcrowded chaotic area (Southern California), there are very few places that you can travel to these days that gives you all the things you get when you visit a town like Moab. It's a small town with friendly locals, one being my husband's grandmother, whom he has been visiting for over 20 years. And now we bring her great grandchildren to see her and to experience a different type of living. The tourist that do frequent the small town are most likely hiking/biking enthusiasts, maybe they're looking for a trail to off-road. The locals anticipate traffic and crowding in town during times like Jeep Safari and marathons. We usually check the calendar to plan around these things so we can avoid the congestion. The idea that Moab would potentially double in population is just wild. It takes away from the feeling of solitary peace that you get from a small town. Not to mention that the area of Kane Creek being a major flood area. I've traveled through that area during various times of the year and there are areas that are not able to be passed. I'm under the impression that the area would be raised 10 ft to avoid that risk. It just seems too risky  and dangerous.",

The proximity we have to for the most pet unmolested nature is notable and I don’t see a reason to reverse that. There is archeological history, precious desert eco systems that deserve to be left alone. Furthermore this development does nothing for our community members in moab, and undermines any sort of priority to address long standing, and very apparent issues we already have that surround a HOUSING CRISIS. There absolutely nothing about pushing out and extracting the people who were living there prior, as well as wildlife, for a high end condo/hotel/retail sprawl, that needs its own sewer treatment, all the while we who live here, I’ve not met a single soul who’s interested in seeing this, are forced to watch this unfold.

This large increase (10% of the Moab population!) in non-local residents will forever change the Moab community and the access that Kane Creek provides to our public lands.\r\n \r\nThis developement is taking advantage of  outdated residential/commercial zoning in a way that is unsustainable for our local and downstream habitats, overburdening our city and taxpayer dollars, as well as the long-term values and well-being of this community that is so conscious and caring for the longevity of our public lands and riverways and the Colorado Plateau. \r\n\r\nI want to see community involvement reinstated in the ongoing development of this project. Our opinions deserve to be considered with high regard and early on in any development projects that would have such a large impact on our local community, and I am disappointed to see this development taking advantage our community.",

Can't afford to buy houses, and can barely afford to rent. Adding a development of this scale and size in this location breaks my heart. Not only did they cause people to be homeless who had been living on the land for decades, and some elderly, but they want to develop this amazingly remote area?! Not to mention, make it inaccessible monetarily to most people who live here?! To me that is not at all in Utah's interest, it'll put a stress on my tax dollars and our natural resources.

    "comment": "These developers are taking advantage of outdated zoning and low-capacity local government to do a large-scale project that is extremely inappropriate for that area. Impact to the river corridor will be large, flood potential is high, it will change the character of the river canyon for the worse for many years, and when they inevitably abandon or sell this project because it’s no longer profitable, we will be left with a hulking facility rotting on the banks of the major waterway of the west. Additionally, watching a megaluxury resort get built in one of the quiet places of moab, displacing a few poor people living in interesting dwellings, when many many people can’t even find a place to rent, feels ugly and sad. What right do these guys have to fuck with a town they don’t live in, building something that no one wants to see, while people who contribute positively to the community end up moving because they can’t afford to stay? They are profiting from the natural wealth that the area offers, while degrading it and contributing nothing.",

    "comment": "     I live and work seasonally in Moab during the peak mountain biking season. I as a seasonal worker already struggle to find affordable housing, and as such choose to live in my vehicle. Moab already has an issue with a lack of low/middle income residencies, and I believe building new high end housing may compound an existing issue of remote workers or second homeowners in many mountain towns taking up space without truly participating in or giving back to the local community and economy. Affordable housing made available to full time residents could help to lessen the regular turnover in residency and available workforce for businesses. \r\n     The recipe of selling land to development to make it available to the wealthy has proven a poor strategy in countless outdoor recreation destinations and this failure need not be repeated in Moab. \r\n     Kane Creek is also an amazing natural place that draws many people to recreate in the desert and experience just how removed you can be from development. There are countless canyons, 4x4 trails, mountain biking and hiking options stemming from Kane Creek road, and it is worth it remaining removed and beautiful. The removal of local residents from their dwellings on the road in the first place was a step in the wrong direction, and a high end develop would be an even greater misstep. \r\n     I understand that things in any place will change and grow, however Kane Creek is the wrong location for this development. It’s is too special of a location, and the intensions of the development do nothing in my opinion to improve quality of life in Moab. It may for some in the short term, but ultimately it is a poor choice.",

    "comment": "I and my family have been coming to grand county since 2010. It is a place near and dear to our hearts, so much so that our daughter moved there after graduating from college. We live in Burnsville NC, also a small town that has and is becoming transformed due to its location and desirability as a location for 2nd (or 3rd,4th), homes to the point that locals are having a hard time finding affordable homes. Teachers, nurses and other middle class people are finding themselves unable to live in their home county. I see similar patterns in Moab. This proposed development will bring no long term benefits to the county, or certainly not enough to offset the harm. One only has to look at nearby Telliride or Aspen or Park City to see the effects and frankly damage such development does to a community. It essentially destroys the community and replaced it with an artificial one tailored around the desires and needs of the Uber-wealthy. Changes come to all communities, and communities either grow or shrink, and Grand county has certainly seen the impact of shrinking. But change and growth doesn’t have to mean loss of identity and allowing unsustainable growth or growth that is tailored to a very small portion of our society and one that really won’t give a damn about Grand county or it’s citizens beyond their ability to cater to its new owners doesn’t and won’t bring anything but harm to the area in the long term. \r\n  Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope you make the right decision in this matter and one that not only you, but your future generations can live with. \r\nWarm regards,\r\nRich Boulter.",

Many people that I talk to here in Durango, where I now live say, \"we can't go to Moab anymore, it's just insane what is happening\" .  \r\n\r\nI mostly say I'm lucky that here in La Plata County, Colorado where we have alot more controls in place for development and use, plus the community has more local power to control it's own destiny.  When people say, maybe we don't need to spend advertising dollars in this market or in that way.  The local tourist board has the power to change how the money is spent.\r\n\r\nThis kind of development is not sustainable for the long run. There's simply not enough infrastructure for uncontrolled development.",

The road access to this area is already unsafe and with so many new users this will significantly increase safety hazards. This area is an incredible scenic resource, provides very important wildlife habitat and, has invaluable archeological resources. This area is also the gateway to Kane creek canyon, which is national park level beautiful.  The level of development in the proposal is essentially high density housing, which is not appropriate, needed or in line with current uses in this area.  There is not a safe or appropriate location for the sewage treatment infrastructure needed for this level of development.  I am already horrified at current development at lions back, and at the expense to tax payers to serve a group of wealthy people that are interested in second homes or airbnbs. I think this development will significantly degrade the special resources of our area and community and I am deeply concerned and opposed to this development.",

Kane Creek is beautiful and provides locals and visitors with tons of history and recreation opportunities just out of town, the development of homes in the area will block views and access to the river for so many people who have grown to love Kane Creek, riding from town to get to the hymasa trailhead will forever be one of my favorite bike rides. In addition to the fact that development of the area will be an eyesore and impede access and protection of nature, it will also send Moab further into the tourist town downspin, these homes are not being built for locals as many people who live in moab year round are faced with housing insecurity. Building more infrastructure will only lead to more issues being created and I feel will truely be the beginning of the end for the Moab local community. Moab has maintained a small local population of people who love and care about the space they call home, Kane Creek has already been a location of housing displacement for people who have lived in Moab for years and the lack of community support from the people living in Moab will cause so much disdain and frustration towards the builders and whomever ends up living in this new development. Keep Moab how it is, we’ve seen what has occurred when places are built that the local community cannot afford, it pushes out people who have resided in those areas for decades, it’s happened in Sedona, Bend, Truckee and more and we have the ability to keep Moab for the people and not just for the rich",

I cherish the environment of Moab, the community and the preservation of the natural beauty of the area. \r\n\r\nMy issues with this development come from both my science background, visual impact and community concerns. The area set to be developed is a large floodplain area, these types of areas between development (i.e. houses and roads) are important for wildlife to access the water and shelter. With the campgrounds already developed along Kane Creek, there will not be much area left for wildlife to roam, reproduce and feed. \r\n\r\nVisually this  development will greatly impact the beauty of the area. Millions of people come to MOab to experience the bliss of the nature and feeling of stillness. Kane creek is an amazing area and the gateway to beautiful nature. Having this many homes developed will greatly increase congestion and traffic to this area, not to mention ruining the aesthetics of the area. Development in the Valley is one thing, but as development expands outward to the  untouched areas, we start to lose the charm of the area, the whole reason we get visitors in the first place. Along with increased developments comes increase pollution and traffic. Thirdly, the negative impact on the towns character and community. Moab is known and loved for its raw, rugged nature. As time goes on, we seem to be ignoring the middle and low income local needs and are pandering to the ultra-rich. Moab has a horrible housing crisis and very minimal is being done that actually is helping the people that run the town (servers, clerks, mechanics, etc) find affordable housing. Moab does not need more 2nd homes! such a waste of time and resources to have homes sitting with no residents in them for most of the year. This influx of very wealthy areas alters the towns character and increases the cost of living.\r\n\r\nI personally know of many people who are starting to NOT visit moab like they used to, due to crowds and change in the towns character. All of our cute ma-and-pa restaurants are tanking and being replaced by more corporate places the lack character. Please reconsider allowing this development to continue, as it will negatively effects our beloved town.",

If construction starts there it will ruin these memories for future generations. There are plenty of areas to build homes, why does it have to be in a canyon with hardly any growth opportunities that is a staple to Moab. Moab has always been about coming out and enjoying nature at its finest, I feel this is going against that for money and greed.This is a place I want to bring my future family for many more years to come.",

You’re pricing the locals out to a point that it’s unaffordable to live in Moab. Grand County has a peace, simplicity, and beauty to it that’s being stripped away with every big development that takes place. The people that have been there for generations no longer have a say because everyone “in charge” thinks about the money and not the people that have kept Moab alive for generations. Those people that you don’t care to listen to… They kept Moab alive when there was no infrastructure, no money, and minimal tourism. Without them, Moab wouldn’t be what it is today. Everyone that travels to Grand County goes to escape the rich, busy city, hustle and bustle. It’s a chance to connect with nature, family, and beauty that Moab has to offer. If Kane Creek gets developed you’re ruining my family’s favorite canyon, and stripping the chance for it to become someone else’s. I’m angry, my family is angry, and so is every other local I’ve spoke to about the atrocity that’s even being proposed. It’s time to listen to what the people are saying! DO NOT BUILD THE KANE CREEK DEVELOPMENT!!!",

The small town feel of Moab Utah is what makes it so special. A neighborhood small enough to know all your neighbors, a quiet and peaceful canyon, and mornings when no one has woken up yet while the birds are chirping. Moab is not special only because it’s a place I visited, but because it has remained Moab. It hasn’t turned into a big city like every other place. It is STILL the exact place I visited as a child, and I hope to take my children there as well. The Kane creek development project would ruin the feeling of this town. It would no longer be the small, tight knit Moab that it has always been. Please stop the Kane creek development project.",

I have been able to witness so many parts if Utah and seen as development has encroached on what was once wild areas, and watched as places that were special and unique turn into towns that are always crowded with traffic and camping that has become overrun. Moab is already bursting at the seams woth visitors and housing issues for residents, it is in a desert where water is scarce and we are already pulling on the Colorado and Green rivers more and more. This development will only add to the stress, pollution, and negative impacts we are dealing with currently. This will take away more public land that people camped on, and public camping that was next to the river as well. Going down river from Moab is always a feeling of getting out of town and having a massive development will only turn into an eyesore and completely ruin the special feeling as you drive down Kane creek or the Potash side, lights slowly ruining the dark skies that offer the suburb star gazing with the redrocks, and noise bouncing down the walls of the canyon.

We have embraced Moab as a spot we could find seclusion in stunningly beautiful places not far off the beaten track-- and not far from Moab itself.  \r\nThe Kane Creek development, however, strikes us as a bridge too far in the scenario of development that one would normally expect even in a popular place like Moab.  We are not alarmists who scoff at reasonable, well-planned and carefully-considered development.  The scope and, to say the least, the location of the Kane Creek development, however, is extremely concerning on many fronts, the idea of such, in our opinion, bordering on folly.  The imminent congestion in this geographically-confined area and the potential for disastrous consequences lead the pack.  Moab has already grown rapidly with difficulties related to congestion and infrastructure in the Spanish Valley corridor.  The idea of a construction project of this magnitude in the narrow Portal corridor begs the question of the judgment of those who are investing in the project and those who approved it.  Was anyone involved who was a completely disinterested party and who had any real say or influence in this project?  We believe the Kane Creek development smacks of blatant greed, without regard for the community, the environment, the surroundings, and even those who may buy property there.  This is clearly the wrong development in the wrong place.  We strongly object to the development moving forward.",

That area is sacred ground especially by the Mastadon where all of my generation and my grandparents and parents have enjoyed for many years. The old Moabites know that is Indian Burial ground and is very sacred. I can’t stand seeing the road going up there already being changed to accommodate rich people who want what’s ours as in for them to destroy something so beautiful just to make a buck. They have gotten away with the mess up by our dump and Lions Back and all of the hotels but this one takes the cake. Why would you even invest into something so beautiful just to destroy it just to make money. Everyone I know from Original Moab and those who live here now are livid over this move. The Colorado River is sacred too and we all know what she can do each year with floods. I’ve seen it for 63 year . Please don’t go thru with this project. It isn’t right.The End Brenda Williams",

They couldn’t care less about the Colorado River or the people who actually live here. \r\nPlease stop this!",

Suffice it to say that I've lived in Moab on and off (mostly on) since the early 1960s. Long ago enough that I spent a night camping and sleeping under Delicate Arch... alone (can you imagine?). Mill Creek Canyon and Kane Creek/Moonflower Canyon, until recent decades, have always been places nearby town where we, the community, could go and experience beauty and silence. How tragic that we're in danger of losing that. \r\n\r\nI and my partner are among the many people who were given a month or so notice to vacate our Kane Creek mobile home of nearly 17 years (~3/4 mi. south of Moonflower Canyon) . I was at the time in extreme pain and had to delay a much needed surgery in order to meet the demands of the developers and former landowner. We were truly blessed and fortunate to find an affordable apartment on Kane Creek Blvd. \r\nWe had a very similar experience on Powerhouse Lane 17 years ago after having lived there for nearly 20 years.\r\n\r\n However, if our experience at Powerhouse Lane is any indicator, money talks\r\n\r\nI consider myself to be extremely fortunate to have lived in two of the most overwhelmingly beautiful places in this community and awesome valley.",

These developments will exploit, overpopulate and pollute what makes this area so special. On a more practical note, this will cause longterm water shortages. There are towns in Arizona that have already run out of water and now have to pay to truck it in from Phoenix. Moab will suffer the same fate if we continue to allow developers to increase the size and population of the town.  Moab's aquifer isn't going to be able to sustain this growth.

For almost 18 years we have been visiting Moab twice a year to visit our daughter (& family) who has lived there for 19 years. We have seen the tremendous growth in high rise hotels, traffic, noise and outrageous housing prices. We’ve enjoyed incredible hikes through the quiet pristine Moonflower Canyon & our granddaughter chose it for her 10th birthday party on December 9. I can’t imagine ever wanting to visit this special area again if this project goes through. This corridor along the Colorado River needs to be protected not exploited!! Not only will there be a massive eye sore built among the cliffs but there will need to be a new road system to get there which, I’m sure, will have to be a causeway to expand the width of the narrow road. Who will be paying for that? The citizens of Moab? Shame on the greedy developers that think this is a good idea. I would hate to see something like this built in our small scenic tourist based community. “Be careful what you wish for”!",

It not only calls for workers to build these sort of huge out of scale developments but also creates more customers across the board. Think; outdoor recreation over crowding, restaurants overcrowded, demand for food and water. Almost all resort towns are experiencing this and it is ruining a way of life for so many and taking away all natural habitats for wildlife and depleting our city and county coffers.

My understanding is that the Highway Commerical zoning designation- which purportedly permits this horrid project- is largely viewed as a mistake, even by planning commissioners. Kane Creek road is obviously not a highway- it’s low volume side road that barely accommodates the traffic to Amasa Back.

    "comment": "I started visiting Moab annually in 2009 for outdoor recreation (climbing and highlining) and wilderness access. I moved here in 2018, finally ready to put down roots and call it home. My partner and I moved 5 times the first year, bouncing between awful or temporary living situations, motels, and slumlord leases. We were about to leave town for good when we secured affordable, stable housing.\r\n\r\nWhat I love(d) about Moab is the access to nature, the unparalleled beauty, the quiet, and the small town community. Over the last 15 years, I’ve seen the changes here exponentially. In the name of economic growth, the quiet is farther and farther out, town is difficult to live in as a resident Spring through Fall when our tiny city center is slammed with millions of visitors, and the landscape has changed progressively as crypto is crushed and new tires tracks appear.\r\n\r\nWhat has not changed since moving here is the housing crisis and I affordability for locals. The only way to make it is to earn your money out of state, have a co-signer, and/or fill your house with roommates to pay a mortgage. This community doesn’t need the environmental impact of a huge development, with long term water use in question, and what should really be a protected area turned into a commercial zone. We don’t need more second and third home owners, and more short term housing that only caters to wealthy visitors. We all know the majority of hiring for the development that happens will be non local as well. \r\n\r\nThis development is a tragedy, and it follows the Lions Back resort and proposed Spanish Valley resorts that are underway. It’s not a decision we can reverse, once this begins, the impact will be lasting. When does it stop? When does the needs and wishes of the local community take precedent over non-local profiteers? The behavior surrounding developing Moab looks like a gold rush, with State decision makers greedily pushing ahead commercial enterprises that will negatively impact our community and the environment for the long term future. \r\n\r\nI am afraid that this place I’ve made my home will wear me down and spit me out—not because of it’s true essence, but because of the capitalist consumerism that only seeks the profits of a place and not it’s preservation.",

I have seen the river flood up to the road’s edge at least twice in the last 20 years, and to a lesser extent almost every spring (enough to replenish the wetlands that are the natural floodplain.) Any permanent development there is a foolish idea, especially one that will inevitably pollute the river when it breaks through the paltry earthen dikes. A sewage treatment plant managed by an HOA is a ridiculous idea - HOAs seldom can agree on what colors of paint to allow, let alone an effort as technical as the treatment of human waste and protection of the river which provides drinking water for downstream population. The residents who are stupid enough to buy into that development are not likely to shell out the money necessary to ensure that the plant meets clean water standards. As a Cataract Canyon river guide, I fear for my own health if this development is allowed to go in.",

The proposed Kane Creek development project  concerns me for these reasons:\r\n\r\n\tEnvironmental Impact: The Colorado River Corridor is a delicate ecosystem. A development of this scale could disrupt local wildlife habitats, increase pollution, and lead to the loss of natural landscapes. Preserving this area is crucial for maintaining biodiversity and the natural beauty that draws all of us Moab in the first place. \r\n       Cultural and Community Concerns: Moab has a unique character that could be overshadowed by such a large-scale development. The project risks altering the small-town feel and close-knit community, replacing it with a more commercialized and less personal atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWhile development and growth are natural parts of any community’s evolution, it is essential that such changes are sustainable, considerate of the existing environment and infrastructure, and in line with the values and needs of current residents. The Kane Creek development project, in its current form, does not appear to meet these criteria.",

This aesthetic desert landscape and the wonderful Moab community holds a special place in my heart unlike any other places I have visited. I am not opposed to growth in Moab if it brings community benefits, however I have to question the proposition to construct more short-term rentals when the workforce housing demand is unmet. As a visitor, I have noticed a decline in local services, such as open hours and speed of service at stores and restaurants, and an uptick in “we’re hiring” signs. These factors have negatively impacted my experience as a tourist, and I think the town/county needs to do more to ensure that it is providing enough work force housing before building a development that will only drive up service demand. I am also concerned about the aesthetic and environmental impacts of this project along the Colorado River and adjacent to some of Moab’s most popular trails and climbing areas, if this development is build I will probably visit those areas less, and I expect that more remote crags and trails may see increased visitation, for better or worse.",

Recent development in and around town has already had a negative impact on the visitor experience for those seeking a less developed, quiet, natural experience, but this proposed development is beyond the pail and entirely unnecessary. Higher density in-town and additional housing that's reserved for full time local employees and residents should be favored over sprawl into natural areas that would create more tourist lodging, especially that which would be only accessible by car. Upscale lodging increases crowding at natural sites, attracts high impact style visitors, and pushes out campers and budget visitors as well as ruining affordability and quality of life for local residents. This area should be part of the river's natural footprint and not even privately owned no less turned into a major development.",

In my time living in Moab I fell in love with the vibrant community in town, the beautiful outdoors, and especially how passionate everyone I knew was in preserving the natural beauty that makes Moab special in the first place. Hearing the news that this development might happen is devastating. It would permanently impact the character of the town, reduce the magic of all the hiking, rafting, and other activities that take place along the Colorado river corridor, and bring even more congestion and unsustainable tourism to a town that cannot support that level of visitation. There are already so many hotels, Airbnbs, and short-term rentals within Moab that make it harder for full-time residents to find housing and live peacefully in this community--adding more will not reduce the problem in other areas of town, but exacerbate this impact while also a detriment to the local ecosystem and waterway. I am strongly against this development prospect, and urge for the plans for development to be cancelled.",

Moab should not be getting a single new room for nightly rentals at this point—that phase of growth has long surpassed it’s usefulness to this beautiful area. What Moab needs is protection of it’s natural resources— you know, the reason that people want to visit in the first place!  And it needs resources and infrastructure to support the people who run this town—people who live and work here. Resources like long term housing and un-commercialized public lands. \r\n\r\nMoab does not need any more short term rentals, anywhere.

This will degrade the experiences out there tremendously; Moonflower canyon, a serene experience of the outdoors, enjoying the beauty of the Colorado along a narrow access road to the Amasa Back recreation area. Heavy increase in waste pollution, & noise will result, and will create a dangerous, and overcrowded roadway situation. We have so few areas left in Moab that makes it attractive to be here. Ruining Kane Creek with an ugly and polluting massive development is NOT the way to improve our town. Stop this plan NOW !!",

What made Kane Creek so special, was the dirt road (with 25mph speed limit) that you had to take your time to enjoy fully. I'm grateful I was able to love it when it was ALIVE.

The desert is a highly sensitive ecosystem and cannot handle the amount of pressure that the growing tourism industry is asking of it. The real solutions are more likely to come from ideas such as requiring permits for certain high-traffic areas and capping visitor numbers while continuing to protect delicate wilderness areas rather than build them up. Kane creek is an especially sensitive area due to the fact that it is a riparian zone and already sees a large amount of tourism from climbing, biking and hiking.",

And now it just sits, leaving those folks to live in their vans or who knows where. These are people who live with the land, not in unaffordable cubicle apartments. Their mental, spiritual, and emotional health, as well as quality of life has been put at risk. They could have allowed those folks to stay, collecting rent from them, until they had their ducks lined up in a row. In my opinion, these are bad people and I don’t want to support anything they do. Secondly, and most obviously, the Kane Creek Corridor is not meant to be developed in a high impact way. I would support a beautiful campground with some eco dwellings along the line of yurts or domes, or glamping tents. Nothing more. Closer to a leave no trace approach.

In the short 20 years I’ve grown up here so has the town, and in my opinion it’s changed for the worse. The sense of community I grew up with isn’t as prominent now as it once was and in my eyes the main reason for this is the amount of hospitality growth.  Yes tourism funds every single one of us but there has to be a line drawn. The more we encourage these huge developments the more it pushes out the true locals and small town appeal that draws in every single person here (locals and tourists alike). The area in which this project is taking place holds a dear spot in my heart as my ancestors developed the egg ranch that once existed down there. This project in particular is taking away generations of preservation and history. Takes away from MY history.",

Part of the lure of Moab is the free spirit that the people bring with it. It’s the lack of major infrastructure. It’s the beautiful Colorado River that runs right through the area, where you can float for miles, next to a road, and feel like you’re in the middle of nowhere. \r\n\r\nMoab is a haven for outdoor enthusiasts. It’s a safe space for dirtbags, nomads, hippies and the like. There is legitimately no place like Moab in this country, and part of that is because there isn’t much infrastructure, especially on the river. \r\n\r\nI’m not opposing building homes, I’m opposing where it’s happening and who for. There aren’t even enough homes for the working citizens of Moab. Most people that make the town run live in rigs without the option or financially ability to find a place to set roots. Building this development will put a very sour taste in locals mouths and will negatively impact the environment surrounding the Colorado and the lure of the city as a whole—not to mention, that road already gets a ton of traffic, increase it by 37% and you have yourselves a nightmare. \r\n\r\nKeep Moab small, keep it beautiful, and if homes are being built, build them for the community and make them affordable. \r\n\r\nP.S. If you have to raise a building 10ft to not be in a flood plain, then you shouldn’t build something there to begin with, especially when you’re dealing with the powerful Colorado River.",

    "comment": "Kane Creek development project simply does nothing to benefit the community, environment, economy and people of Moab.  It is environmentally a disaster waiting to happen.  It mars and destroys a scenic wonder that draws international visitors - the Colorado River waterway.  On principle we lose so much with this development.  Where is the line drawn?  Where do we stop building?  Development?  How about re-develop critical desert riparian habitat that we all value and need in this town if we are to exist as the rural resort town we are.  Take a look at the Colorado River along it's entire length.  Take a look at what little remains.  If you claim to be bolstering the construction industry and housing - build somewhere else.   This is NOT the place to build.  Absolutely not.  Since the beginning of time, rivers have swollen and consumed everything built too close to their bank.  This is no different.  Everything about this development is a red flag.  No one in Moab wants to drive/run/walk/bike/whatever down Kane Creek and see this crap.  It's really that simple.",

I collected native seeds in this area, so more native plants could be grown in a local nursery. This is such a rich area in terms of diversity of species.

The wildlife that roam the river banks and the native ancestors that used to live there and have left their marks in the form of petroglyphs deserve to be respected and honored. Moab has so many other establishments in town, outer banks of town deserve to remain as respected  primal land without modern day establishments taking over. The lack of big malls or shopping centers is what makes Moab unique to most other places. All of town running along Main Street and then lots of pure nature surrounding it is a very unique thing about Moab compared to other places, building large establishments on kane creek will take this away from our beautiful home",

The fact that just across the street from this development site is public land protected as a Wilderness Study Area demonstrates the high value of natural character that remains here. Developing would not only impact riparian habitat for wildlife and vegetation, but would also raise concerns for pollution of ground water and the river itself. Countless cultural sites considered sacred to indigenous peoples in this area are subject to increased vandalism and damage from increased visitors and development. Building in the flood plain of the mighty Colorado river should raise its own red flags that need no further explanation. The character of our community would be drastically diminished both for locals and visitors alike if this view shed, and epic natural corridor sees more traffic, construction and pavement, infrastructure, parking, lights, etc. The wild open space Moab is revered for can only handle so much fragmentation before we lose the character of why we live here and why folks from around the world sustain our community by visiting. While lands in Spanish Valley seem ripe for housing development with fewer impact, we must think ahead to future generations , knowing that this decision has great impacts both intrinsically and by setting precedent for future development.",

As an east coasterner (to coin a term), I see everyday the result of loss of public space for most of the east, I live in Maryland, is overdeveloped with nary a shred of publicly accessible natural areas. This often results in environmental degradation (Chesapeake bay for example) and obviously limits areas where all people can go to enjoy the great outdoors. It’s definitely concerning to see a development proposal such as this in such a pristine, beautiful spot in an area that should certainly be protected and made accessible to the public.

Housing is a big issue for Moab residents and the Kane Creek development project addresses none of the known issues and creates many more. The road to access the development is no where near suited to that much increased traffic, and will likely bar Moab residents and visitors alike from accessing the trailheads in the area. Moab doesn't need more short term rental property. It needs housing for people who actually live there. Not to mention building in a floodplain is structurally and environmentally dangerous. Rather than developing an environmentally sensitive area, Moab needs better water, roadway, and visitor management. The only people who would benefit from this project are external parties. Anyone who actually lives, works, and recreates in Moab would have their quality of life damaged by this project",

I see a lot of wildlife in there .not to mention, when it rains, so many beautiful waterfalls, making the road and area a little more dangerous to drive on. It’s one of the most unique places, to be able to drive through such an incredible place, there’s not many places like that in the world. The road is already narrow, but is ok for being a back road. They would have to make the road bigger,and they  have had to take down so many huge old beautiful poplar trees. And because it’s also a flood plain they will need to raise everything up at least 10 ft. And it will still have flooding problems from the river and the waterfalls when it rains. Not to mention that it is the beginning to some awesome trails for 4x4’s,  biking and hiking.. that the traffic has always increased a lot over the past few years, so what’s going to happen when you put that many more buildings and other stuff, the traffic will be horrible! And the people that move there will definitely be complaining!! And the idea of also having to put some sort of sewer treatment just scares me .",

Kane creek road is a beautiful place to camp but doesn’t need 200-500 new houses built on it. If it is partially commercially zoned, where would the workers live? Not in Moab, because there’s no places to buy or rent that are affordable. Unless those commercial areas are paying $30-$35 an hour. I’ve worked in Moab for 2 years and have moved 3 times because landlords keep deciding to sell or turn the rentals into short term rentals. The Kane creek development is also quite close to the river, which is pretty, but would add more pollution to the river because people don’t pick up after themselves and trash will easily be blown into it since winds can get pretty gusty and trash cans aren’t immune to falling over. Add in heavy rains and while it may not flood, the water coming down from the rim is going to pull all trash, debris and pollution directly into the river. All in all, it’s disappointing to see Moab constantly being sold out for more and more tourist areas and short term rentals instead of helping the residents who live here and those who have grown up in Moab. Bettering the community and conserving the nature around us should be the #1 goal of anyone coming into Moab.",

There seems to be a certain neglect by developers for the already existing homes there with a lack of drainage systems in key places and continuous uprooting of extremely important foliage that are key components to preventing floods. The hardships that these residents endure at the expense of more and more construction and development is apparent every day. Moab is a gem for its natural features and culture, and bringing in more and more construction and tourists will make into just another huge, trashed tourist destination. We should be preserving this place for what is, not exploiting it for financial benefit. The money that would be used for this should be going towards the people, homes, and businesses that are already there.This is greed at its finest.",

This development (and many others) have forced its own employees out of this town. Most people that run the businesses of Moab and make its economy function are living out of their cars on the streets and in the outer nature areas. I love this area with my whole heart, and I too have had to live in my car to be able to afford living and working in Moab.

First of all, these developers are trying to trick people in believing they are helping the ecosystem by naming their corporation in a way that makes them seem like they’re in an environmental advocacy key group, when in fact they are developers. Second, I can’t see how it’s possible to have 2000+ people on such a tiny sliver of floodplain. How will there not be septic system leaks into the river? How will the river quality not be compromised? How will further erosion and degradation of soil quality not be compromised? How will there not be traffic, congestion, and accidents where King Creek turns the corner into the river corridor? How many of these units will be allocated for locals? How many of them will be affordable for locals? We have a moratorium on hotels, because the recent USDA water study shows that we have a lot less water in our aquifer than we thought we did. How was it then possible that we’re allowing a 2000 unit dwelling to be built when we are not allowing hotels . Where will the water come from for another 3000 or so new residents? Will these all be second homes? Will the people buying these homes just put further stress on our local residents ? Who will be serving these 2000 to 3000 more people? These are just a few of the many concerns I have.",

Also Moab is suppose to be a small outdoorsy town, don’t try to make it a city, next thing you know you have to build a bunch more roads and highways and it will just build on its self till Moab is another salt lake, Provo, price, etc. and to keep this short I won’t get into the impact on the wildlife out there and plant life and possible the river.

The grove of cottonwoods provides protection for wildlife, helps propagation of cottonwood trees, which are threatened by tamarisk-a non-native invasive plant. Having wild, underdeveloped areas protects riparian species as well. The shade and roots offer habitat for endangered fish species of the Colorado and other river wildlife, such as otters and beaver. The feel of the area as one goes farther along Kane Creek is one of wildness, beauty and serenity. This is all lost if 2000 units go in. High-end, meaning average locals who already struggle with housing will continue to struggle as prices  rise farther beyond their reach. Kane Creek should stay wild-not every inch of this beautiful wild country needs to be developed, commercialized for a greedy few.",

    "comment": "There are many reasons to be against this development. firstly, travel down Kane creek road is already difficult during tourist season. It is not a road capable of handling more traffic, and the options to widen the road are dismal, at best. \r\n\r\nThe development in that area will negatively affect the wildlife as well as natural landscapes. Deer reside in that area most of the year, and I have even seen bears in that area before. We continue to push them out of their natural habitats by building all around the moab area. river access is very important to the livelihood of these animals, and cutting off that access will ultimately drive them away. Part of what makes moab so special is our towns ability to allow animals to reside here in some way. \r\n\r\nThe waste that will inevitably make its way into the river is another large concern. From construction to negligence from occupants, trash and other forms of waste in the Colorado river will now increase. \r\n\r\nMoab is a dark sky region. The town itself already puts off enough light pollution. Kane Creek is the closest place to town that provides a bit better view of our night sky. Putting these buildings on this road will eliminate that. \r\n\r\nMy name is Derrick. I have been a moab resident since 2016, purchasing property here in 2021. I have worked full time for skydive moab since 2019, and part time for the moab brewery since 2017. This is my home. The problems this town faces are not being addressed in any way by building these residencies. If anything, the construction of these units will further increase the problems that moab locals are facing. There is enough housing for visitors and tourists alike. Focusing on high end housing for tourists is a clear sign that the residents of this town, who are the people that keep this town running, are of less interest than the tourists who come here for a week.",

I had to leave Moab as a resident, unable to find affordable housing in 2017. Short term rentals have turned housing into a business for those wealthy enough to gain entry into the market. This has raised housing prices beyond the reach of most residents of Moab. These short term rentals are owned by out-of-state or out-of-town residents looking to make a profit off airbnbs and VRBO style offerings. The only interest in community investment these developers are seeking are those improvements which would make their short term rentals more profitable. The over congestion of Kane creek road will also make the area far less desirable to visit in the future.",

It won’t help with the housing crisis. It will have very big negative impacts on the environment. How can we allow anyone to build permanent structure on a historic floodplain? With fill dirt? This is ludicrous. This is clearly a lot of natural habitat that the people of Moab care about protecting. We should be designating some this area to farming food to feed the community. Not putting in more “housing”. We need to start taxing the hell out of second and third homes that are unoccupied most of time. We need to increase the taxes on nightly rentals, and hotels.

It's a dangerous place to build (in a floodplain), it will destroy the natural beauty of this area and it's ecosystem, which I have grown up with and loved my entire life. This area is one of the last places that locals can escape to, that is close to town, but feels secluded. A development like this, isn't for the locals of Moab, who keep this place running. It's for the rich and the greedy. By all means, build this out in Spanish Valley, not in such a beautiful place. This is wrong, and we all know it.",
